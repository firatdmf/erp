# Code of Conduct

At Nejum, we’re building something good — so let’s act like it.

- Be respectful.  
- No harassment, hate, or discrimination.  
- Keep it constructive.  
- Help each other.

Violations aren’t welcome and will be handled appropriately.

Let’s make this a place where people actually want to contribute.
