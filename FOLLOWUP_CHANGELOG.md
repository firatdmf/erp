# Follow-Up System - Change Log

## ✅ Update: Immediate First Email (Current Behavior)

### What Changed

The system now sends **Email 1 immediately** when you save a company as a prospect, instead of waiting 3 days.

### New Email Schedule

| Email | When Sent | Days After Previous |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Email 1** | **Immediately** | When you save the company |
| Email 2 | Day 3 | 3 days after Email 1 |
| Email 3 | Day 10 | 7 days after Email 2 |
| Email 4 | Day 24 | 14 days after Email 3 |
| Email 5 | Day 54 | 30 days after Email 4 (Final) |

### Old Schedule (Previous Behavior)

| Email | When Sent |
|-------|-----------|
| Email 1 | Day 3 |
| Email 2 | Day 10 |
| Email 3 | Day 24 |
| Email 4 | Day 54 |
| Email 5 | Day 114 |

### How It Works Now

1. **You add a company** with `status="prospect"` and an email address
2. **Email 1 is sent immediately** via Django signal
3. **Follow-up tracking is created** for the remaining 4 emails
4. **Remaining emails (2-5)** are sent by the management command on schedule

### Technical Changes

**Files Modified:**
- `erp/crm/signals.py` - Added immediate email sending
- `erp/crm/models.py` - Updated schedule logic and docstrings
- `README_FOLLOWUP_SYSTEM.md` - Updated documentation
- `FOLLOWUP_QUICKSTART.md` - Updated schedule
- `FOLLOWUP_EMAIL_SETUP.md` - Updated schedule
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated timeline

**How It Works:**
- Django `post_save` signal fires when company is created
- If company is prospect with email → Send Email 1 immediately
- Mark email as sent (counter = 1)
- Management command handles emails 2-5 on schedule

### Testing the Change

1. **Add a new prospect company** with an email address
2. **Check your email** - You should receive Email 1 immediately
3. **Check admin panel** - `/admin/crm/companyfollowup/`
4. You'll see `emails_sent_count = 1` right away

### Important Notes

- ✅ Email 1 is now sent **synchronously** when saving company
- ✅ If email sending fails, error is logged but company still saves
- ✅ Follow-ups 2-5 still require running the management command
- ✅ Total sequence is now 54 days instead of 114 days

### Migration Required?

**No database migration needed!** The change is only in the business logic, not the database schema.

### What If Email 1 Fails to Send?

- Company is still saved successfully
- `emails_sent_count` remains at 0
- Error is logged
- You can check logs or admin panel to see failed sends
- Email 2 won't be sent until Email 1 count is registered

### Reverting to Old Behavior

If you want to go back to the old schedule (no immediate email):

1. Edit `erp/crm/signals.py`
2. Remove the email sending code from the signal
3. Adjust the schedule in `models.py` back to [3, 7, 14, 30, 60]
