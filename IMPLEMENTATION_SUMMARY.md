# Follow-Up Email System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

I've implemented a complete automated follow-up email system for your Nejum ERP that sends scheduled emails to prospect companies via Gmail SMTP.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Follow-Up Tracking** (`CompanyFollowUp` Model)
- Automatically creates a follow-up record when a company is added with status="prospect"
- Tracks email sending progress (0-5 emails)
- Records when emails were sent
- Stores the reason when follow-ups stop

### 2. **Django Signals** (Automatic Event Handling)
- **On company creation**: Automatically starts follow-up tracking for prospects with emails
- **On status change**: Automatically stops follow-ups when status changes from "prospect"

### 3. **Email Sending System** (`email_utils.py`)
- Sends HTML emails via Gmail SMTP
- Includes email configuration testing function
- Proper error handling and logging
- Customizable sender information

### 4. **5 Email Templates** (Professional HTML)
- `followup_1.html` - Initial introduction
- `followup_2.html` - Case study and benefits
- `followup_3.html` - Pain points addressed
- `followup_4.html` - New features check-in
- `followup_5.html` - Final farewell email

### 5. **Management Command** (`send_followup_emails`)
- Can be run manually or via cron
- Includes dry-run mode for testing
- Detailed output with progress tracking
- Alerts when companies reach the 5-email limit
- Can target specific companies for testing

### 6. **Admin Panel Integration**
- View all follow-up sequences
- Filter by status, email count
- Search by company name/email
- Manual controls to stop/manage follow-ups

## How It Works

### The Flow

1. **You add a company** with `status="prospect"` and an email address
   
2. **Signal fires** (`post_save`) → Creates `CompanyFollowUp` record
   
3. **Daily cron job runs** (or you run manually):
   ```bash
   python manage.py send_followup_emails
   ```
   
4. **Command checks schedule**:
   - Is it time for the next email? (3, 7, 14, 30, or 60 days since last)
   - Is the company still a prospect?
   - Are follow-ups still active?
   
5. **Sends email** via Gmail SMTP
   
6. **Updates tracking**:
   - Increments email counter
   - Records timestamp
   - Stops if 5 emails reached
   
7. **Auto-stops if**:
   - Status changes to anything other than "prospect"
   - 5 emails have been sent
   - You manually disable in admin

### Email Schedule Timeline

```
Day 0:  Company added as prospect
        ✉️ Email 1 - Introduction (sent immediately!)
Day 3:  ✉️ Email 2 - Case study (3 days after #1)
Day 10: ✉️ Email 3 - Pain points (7 days after #2)
Day 24: ✉️ Email 4 - Check-in (14 days after #3)
Day 54: ✉️ Email 5 - Final email (30 days after #4)
        🛑 System stops and notifies you
```

## Configuration Required

### Gmail Setup

1. Enable 2-Step Verification in your Google Account
2. Generate App Password (Security → App passwords)
3. Add to `erp/.env`:
   ```
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
   
   # Optional customization:
   FOLLOWUP_SENDER_NAME=Your Name
   FOLLOWUP_SENDER_TITLE=Your Title
   FOLLOWUP_SENDER_COMPANY=Your Company
   ```

### Cron Setup (for automatic daily runs)

```bash
crontab -e
# Add:
0 9 * * * /Users/muhammed/Code/erp/vir_env/bin/python /Users/muhammed/Code/erp/erp/manage.py send_followup_emails >> /Users/muhammed/Code/erp/followup_emails.log 2>&1
```

## Testing the System

### 1. Test Email Configuration
```bash
/Users/muhammed/Code/erp/vir_env/bin/python erp/manage.py shell
>>> from crm.email_utils import test_email_configuration
>>> success, message = test_email_configuration()
>>> print(message)
```

### 2. Dry Run (See what would be sent)
```bash
/Users/muhammed/Code/erp/vir_env/bin/python erp/manage.py send_followup_emails --dry-run
```

### 3. Test with One Company
```bash
/Users/muhammed/Code/erp/vir_env/bin/python erp/manage.py send_followup_emails --company-id 123
```

## Key Features

✅ **Fully Automated** - No manual intervention needed after setup
✅ **Smart Stopping** - Stops on status change or after 5 emails
✅ **Safe Testing** - Dry-run mode prevents accidental sends
✅ **Professional Templates** - HTML emails with your branding
✅ **Detailed Tracking** - Monitor all follow-ups in admin panel
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful failures with logging
✅ **Notification System** - Alerts when sequences complete

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Gmail App Password** (see FOLLOWUP_EMAIL_SETUP.md)
2. **Add credentials to `.env`** file
3. **Test the system** with `--dry-run`
4. **Customize email templates** if desired
5. **Set up cron job** for automatic daily runs
6. **Monitor in admin panel** at `/admin/crm/companyfollowup/`
