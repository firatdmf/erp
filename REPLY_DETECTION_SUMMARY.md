# Automatic Reply Detection - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Built

I've implemented an automatic reply detection system that:

1. **Monitors Gmail** for replies from prospect companies
2. **Stops follow-ups automatically** when a reply is detected
3. **Creates tasks** in your todo list to remind you to reply back

## 🎯 How It Works

```
Company replies to your email
         ↓
Cron job runs hourly: check_email_replies
         ↓
Gmail API detects the reply
         ↓
System automatically:
  - Stops follow-up emails ✓
  - Creates "Reply back" task ✓
         ↓
You see task in your todo list
         ↓
You reply to the company
         ↓
Mark task as complete
```

## 🚀 Setup Required (One Time)

### Step 1: Install Python Packages
```bash
cd /Users/muhammed/Code/erp
/Users/muhammed/Code/erp/vir_env/bin/pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```

### Step 2: Set Up Gmail API (15 minutes)

Follow the detailed guide in **`GMAIL_API_SETUP.md`**:

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create project & enable Gmail API
3. Create OAuth credentials
4. Download `gmail_credentials.json`
5. Move to project root: `/Users/muhammed/Code/erp/gmail_credentials.json`

### Step 3: Authenticate
```bash
/Users/muhammed/Code/erp/vir_env/bin/python erp/manage.py shell
```

In Python shell:
```python
from crm.gmail_service import test_gmail_authentication
success, message = test_gmail_authentication()
print(message)
# Browser opens -> Sign in -> Allow -> Done!
exit()
```

### Step 4: Test It
```bash
/Users/muhammed/Code/erp/vir_env/bin/python erp/manage.py check_email_replies --hours-back 24
```

### Step 5: Set Up Cron (Automatic)
```bash
crontab -e

# Add:
# Check for replies every hour
0 * * * * /Users/muhammed/Code/erp/vir_env/bin/python /Users/muhammed/Code/erp/erp/manage.py check_email_replies --hours-back 24 >> /Users/muhammed/Code/erp/reply_check.log 2>&1
```

## 📋 Commands

### Check for Replies
```bash
# Default (last 24 hours)
python erp/manage.py check_email_replies

# Last 48 hours
python erp/manage.py check_email_replies --hours-back 48

# Specific company
python erp/manage.py check_email_replies --company-id 123
```

### Test Authentication
```bash
python erp/manage.py shell
>>> from crm.gmail_service import test_gmail_authentication
>>> test_gmail_authentication()
```

## 🎯 What Happens When Reply Is Detected

### 1. **Follow-Up Stops**
- `is_active` → False
- `stopped_reason` → "reply_received"
- No more follow-up emails sent

### 2. **Task Created**
```
Name: "Reply back to [Company Name]"
Description: 
  - Company replied on [date]
  - Preview of their message
  - Company email address
Due Date: Tomorrow
Linked to: Company
```

### 3. **View Task**
- Admin panel: `/admin/todo/task/`
- Or your todo module interface

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check if System is Working
```bash
# View reply check log
tail -f /Users/muhammed/Code/erp/reply_check.log

# View follow-up log
tail -f /Users/muhammed/Code/erp/followup_emails.log
```

### Check Cron Jobs
```bash
crontab -l
```

Should show:
```
0 9 * * * ... send_followup_emails ...
0 * * * * ... check_email_replies ...
```

## 📊 Admin Panel Views

### See Follow-Ups Status
```
/admin/crm/companyfollowup/
```
- Filter by: `stopped_reason = "reply_received"`
- See which companies replied

### See Reply Tasks
```
/admin/todo/task/
```
- Filter by: `name contains "Reply back"`
- See all pending replies

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test
1. Add a test company with your own email
2. Email 1 will be sent immediately
3. Reply to that email
4. Run: `python erp/manage.py check_email_replies`
5. Check:
   - Follow-up stopped? ✓
   - Task created? ✓

## 🔐 Security

- **Read-only access**: System can only read Gmail (not send/delete)
- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure authentication
- **Credentials**: Never committed to git
- **Revoke anytime**: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions

## ⚙️ Configuration

### No additional env variables needed!
Uses existing `EMAIL_HOST_USER` from `.env`

### File locations
- Credentials: `/Users/muhammed/Code/erp/gmail_credentials.json`
- Token: `/Users/muhammed/Code/erp/gmail_token.pickle`
- Logs: `/Users/muhammed/Code/erp/reply_check.log`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Gmail credentials file not found"
- Download from Google Cloud Console
- Move to: `/Users/muhammed/Code/erp/gmail_credentials.json`

### "Authentication failed"
- Delete token: `rm gmail_token.pickle`
- Re-authenticate: `python erp/manage.py shell` → test_gmail_authentication()

### "No replies found" (but there are replies)
- Check company email is correct
- Increase hours-back: `--hours-back 48`
- Check follow-up is still active
