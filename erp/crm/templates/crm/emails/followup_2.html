        <p>Hi {{ company.name }} team,</p>
        
        <p>I wanted to follow up on my previous email about how our ERP solution could benefit {{ company.name }}.</p>
        
        <p>I understand you're probably busy, but I thought you might be interested in a quick case study: One of our clients reduced their operational overhead by 30% within the first quarter of implementation.</p>
        
        <p>Key benefits they experienced:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Real-time inventory tracking</li>
            <li>Automated financial reporting</li>
            <li>Streamlined customer management</li>
            <li>Better visibility across operations</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Would it be valuable to explore how we could achieve similar results for {{ company.name }}?</p>
        
        <p>Let me know if you'd like to schedule a quick demo or have any questions.</p>
        
        <p>Best regards,</p>
