Remember that the emphasis of an MVP is on simplicity and usability. You want to launch quickly to gather user feedback and iterate on your CRM based on real user experiences. As you receive feedback and understand user needs better, you can expand and enhance the CRM with additional features and integrations in future iterations. The key is to start with the core functionality that solves a specific problem for your target users.

STEP 5: FINDING FIRST CUSTOMERS

If you made sure you’re building something that people need, if you’ve nurtured and connected with those folks for months before the launch, have put out solid content, and have kept folks excited along the way, you WILL get customers on launch day. But your app isn’t going to be beautiful yet (and you shouldn't wait until it's beautiful to launch), and folks won’t mind as long as the main functions are there.

So what I said was:

We’re going to be pricing this product at $x price per month.

We’re going to be adding a ton of features

Sign up now while it's still ugly at a discounted price, like 60% of $x and you’ll be grandfathered in at that price forever and take advantage of all the sweet updates and additional features at no additional cost.

This works like a charm!

IMPORTANT: So the revenue from first customers pays for ongoing development and we never had to put any more money into the platform!!!!!
