Remember that the emphasis of an MVP is on simplicity and usability. 
You want to launch quickly to gather user feedback and iterate on your CRM based on real user experiences. 
As you receive feedback and understand user needs better, you can expand and enhance the CRM with additional features and integrations in future iterations. 
The key is to start with the core functionality that solves a specific problem for your target users.

Todo:Acc
Alter currency based on selected cash account /
stay on the reporting page after pushing submit button
record each day's KPI on a table (better for analysis, and speed)
Deleting a transaction or expense does not adjust the account balance.
Adjust others: exp: categories-COGS, rev: rewards-refunds-sales, Capital + Divident
add currency exchanged between two different accouns ib usd to ib try
product variant names should be unique
parent skue should be a required field, and the variant sku should contain and extend to it.




Things to consider:

Sometimes not every money you take out is expense or divident. You perhaps receive money on behalf of someone.
On transactions list, the exchanges does not state + or - operations 
make in transfer and make currency exchange objects are not saved
click on transaction to see details does not yet work
when expenses etc adjusted manually, it might mess up the whole system.
